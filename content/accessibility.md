The Penn Carey Law AI Project is committed to digital accessibility for the entire Penn Carey Law community and the broader public. This site is built to meet the [University of Pennsylvania's digital accessibility policy](https://accessibility.web-resources.upenn.edu/overview-accessibility-penn/standards) and the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).

## Conformance target

This site targets **WCAG 2.2, Level AA conformance**, the standard Penn applies to University websites created or significantly revised after July 1, 2024.

## What this site is built to do

- **Semantic HTML** — every page uses standard landmark elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) so assistive technologies can navigate the structure.
- **Skip-to-content link** — keyboard users can bypass the header and jump directly to page content.
- **Visible focus indicators** — every interactive element shows a Penn-Red outline on keyboard focus.
- **Contrast** — body text and link colors meet or exceed WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and non-text indicators), verified by automated testing (axe) across the site.
- **Keyboard support** — every feature, including the search dialog, is designed to be operable without a mouse; the dialog is designed to trap focus while open and close with the Escape key. A full manual keyboard and screen-reader pass is in progress and not yet complete — if you find something that doesn't work, please report it below.
- **Screen-reader text** — external links and icon-only buttons include text for assistive technologies, including a "(opens in new tab)" announcement on links that open externally.
- **Reduced motion** — animations and transitions are suppressed for users who set `prefers-reduced-motion` at the OS level.
- **Plain language** — Toolkit and project pages are written for direct, scannable reading.

Automated scanning (axe) currently finds zero violations across the site. Automated tools catch a meaningful share of issues but not all of them — the manual verification above is what closes that gap, and it's still open.

## Known limitations

- **PDF and Word attachments** — some legacy documents linked from the site may not be fully accessible. We are migrating these to native web pages as we update them. If you encounter a document you cannot use, contact us using the form below and we will provide an accessible alternative.
- **Embedded video and audio** — recordings of past events may not have captions or transcripts. Captions and transcripts are added when we host new recordings; older content is being remediated as resources allow.
- **Third-party tools** — some pages embed search functionality (Pagefind) and external content (GitHub repositories, vendor documentation). We choose tools that meet WCAG 2.1 AA where possible, but third-party content may not meet our standard.

## How to report a barrier

If you encounter content on this site that is not accessible to you, please contact us. We will work to address the issue and, when possible, provide an accessible alternative within five business days.
